## Who is Dr. Tamilselvi?
- Professor of Information Technology at Thiagarajar College of Engineering (TCE), Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India
- PhD in Robotics from Anna University (2013)
- 23+ years of academic experience
- 10+ years building VR/AR assistive technology for children with autism
- Founded: Cognitive Science Research Group - CSRG (2014), VR Lab (2018), Assistive Technology Club - ATC (2022)
- Startup: TXR Solutions, incubated at IIT Madras GDC I-NCUBATE (18th Cohort)

## Core Work: VR Therapy for Autism
- Uses virtual reality to create safe, engaging therapy environments for children with autism
- Methodology: "Compare and Contrast" — structured assessments through repeated VR interactions
- Multi-stakeholder approach: therapists, parents, teachers, and doctors all participate
- VR Environments built: Enchanting Forest (sensory regulation), Ride to Destiny (decision-making), Virtual Fishing (motor coordination), Kitchen Safety, Traffic Awareness, Social Interaction Trainer
- Equipment: HTC Vive Pro, Meta Quest 2 & 3, motion sensors
- Funded by DST-CSRI grant of Rs. 33.8 Lakh

## Impact
- 8+ special schools visited across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
- 1000+ children interacted with
- 80+ students mentored
- 33 publications (Springer, IEEE, international conferences)
- Schools: Spark Vidhyala (Madurai), Sathya Special School (Pondicherry — gave formal Letter of Appreciation), Deepam Special School (Auroville), Rakshana Child Care Center (Madurai), Shaksham Deeemahi (Madurai), Shristi Village (Mayelam), JIPMER Pondicherry (clinical endorsement), NIEPMD Chennai, Thai Special School (Salem), Government Schools (Virudhunagar District)
- Letter of Appreciation from Sathya School confirms "visible improvement in attention span and social interaction"

## Awards & Recognition

## The Ecosystem Vision (Future Roadmap)
Nine interconnected assistive products sharing one intelligence layer:
1. NeuroSense — Multi-modal input platform with 13 modalities (sensory mats, EMG, gaze tracking) — the body becomes the controller
2. ECHO Hear — Semantic comprehension accelerator for 63M+ Indians with hearing impairment (meaning layer, not just sound amplification)
3. ECHO Voice — ISL-to-Tamil speech system and adaptive communication accelerator for the deaf (wrist sonar + AR glasses, Rs.29,400 vs Rs.2.6L+)
4. EMBOSS — AI-powered tactile STEM display for blind students (renders actual geometric shapes, Rs.22,500 vs Rs.12-15L imported)
5. SIGHTLINE — AI robotic vision companion for the visually impaired, built for Indian roads (LIDAR + camera, contextual navigation)
6. Smart Wheelchair — ADAS retrofit platform for existing wheelchairs in 3 tiers (Rs.30K / Rs.80K / Rs.1.8L) — 7M wheelchair users in India
7. ExoForce — Lightweight wearable exoskeleton with hybrid actuation (assist/resist/game modes) from Rs.30K-60K vs Rs.29L-1.65Cr imported
8. CareSync — RBAC-powered care coordination platform connecting parents, therapists, teachers, and doctors around each child
9. Smart Care Vision — Contextual AI camera system with Guardian mode (elderly) and Ally mode (neurodiverse) — edge processing, privacy-first

Framework: Sense → Understand → Act → Connect
